# Project-1
Group project
“This project aims to gain insights into the patterns and trends of natural disasters in the US over the past 70 years. It involves:
identifying the most common types of disasters and total occurrences within different regions throughout the U.S., 
analyzing the frequency of disasters over the years, 
investigating correlations between disaster types and their occurrences in certain times of the year and 
assessing the effectiveness of disaster declarations and responses. 
The analysis will utilize various data visualization techniques such as bar charts, time series line plots, pie charts, and stacked bar charts to present the findings effectively.”
