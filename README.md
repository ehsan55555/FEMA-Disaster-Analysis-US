Natural Disasters Analysis in the United States

Overview:

This project aims to gain insights into the patterns and trends of natural disasters in the US over the past 70 years. It involves identifying the most common types of disasters and total occurrences within different regions throughout the U.S., analyzing the frequency of disasters over the years, investigating correlations between disaster types and their occurrences in certain times of the year, and assessing the effectiveness of disaster declarations and responses. The analysis will utilize various data visualization techniques such as bar charts, time series line plots, pie charts, and stacked bar charts to present the findings effectively.


Data Sources:

The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset of natural disaster declarations in the United States. The primary data source is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) database, containing records of disaster declarations from 1953 to 2023. Additional geospatial data from the Geoapify API is used to map the disasters to their respective locations.


Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: The original dataset is cleaned and formatted to remove any inconsistencies and missing values. The datetime columns are converted to pandas Timestamps for further analysis.

Disaster Type Analysis: The most common types of disasters are identified by analyzing the frequency distribution of incident types in the dataset.

Temporal Analysis: The frequency of disasters over the years is visualized using a time series line plot to identify any long-term trends or patterns.

Financial Response Time Analysis: The average financial response time in months for each disaster type is calculated and presented using bar charts to compare the efficiency of disaster response across different states.


Key Findings:

Severe Storms emerge as one of the most prevalent natural disasters, accounting for 27.3% of all recorded incidents, highlighting their recurrent nature and significant impact on communities, particularly in regions prone to severe weather events.

Floods represent a substantial portion of the dataset, accounting for 16.7% of incidents, underlining their recurring occurrence and the critical need for effective floodplain management and preparedness measures.

Hurricanes, with a share of 20.4%, are a substantial portion of the dataset, emphasizing the recurring threat they pose to coastal and inland areas, leading to devastating consequences.

Biological incidents, comprising 12.3% of the dataset, indicate the importance of addressing public health preparedness and response strategies in the face of emerging diseases and pandemics.

California has the longest financial response time to severe storms, possibly due to its complex geography and densely populated areas, which may lead to challenges in rapid disaster response.

Vermont experiences the longest financial response time to biological disasters, such as COVID-19, potentially due to its rural population distribution and limited healthcare infrastructure.

South Carolina and Maryland have the longest financial response times for floods, which may be attributed to their susceptibility to heavy rainfall and coastal storm surges, requiring comprehensive mitigation strategies.


Data Visualization:

The analysis is visualized using various charts and graphs, including bar charts for comparing financial response times across states for different disaster types, Pie charts showing the disaster types and the percentage of the frequency which they occurred. Also includes a line plot and bar plot showing the spikes during the years, number of disasters per month/season.


Conclusion:

Through this data analysis, we have gained valuable insights into the patterns and trends of natural disasters in the United States. The findings underscore the importance of disaster preparedness, mitigation, and response strategies to safeguard communities from the impact of these recurring incidents. The analysis serves as a foundation for informed decision-making and policy development to enhance disaster resilience across the nation.
